# Artifactory Proxy Resource

Provides an Artifactory Proxy resource.

This resource configuration corresponds to 'proxies' config block in system configuration XML
(REST endpoint: [artifactory/api/system/configuration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-GeneralConfiguration)).

**NOTE:** The `artifactory_proxy` resource utilizes endpoints which are blocked/removed in SaaS environments (i.e. in Artifactory online), rendering this resource incompatible with Artifactory SaaS environments.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "artifactory_proxy" "my-proxy" {
  key               = "my-proxy"
  host              = "my-proxy.mycompany.com"
  port              = 8888
  username          = "user1"
  password          = "password"
  nt_host           = "MYCOMPANY.COM"
  nt_domain         = "MYCOMPANY"
  platform_default  = false
  redirect_to_hosts = ["redirec-host.mycompany.com"]
  services          = ["jfrt", "jfxr"]
}
```
